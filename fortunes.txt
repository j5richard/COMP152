Don't behave with cold manners
Don't forget you are always on our minds
Fortune not found? Abort, Retry, Ignore
You think it's a secret, but they know
It's about time I got out of that cookie
Never forget a friend. Especially if he owes you
Never wear your best pants when you go to fight for freedom
Only listen to the fortune cookie; disregard all other fortune telling units
It is a good day to have a good day
All fortunes are wrong except this one
Someone will invite you to a Karaoke party
That wasn't chicken
There is no mistake so great as that of being always right
You love Chinese food
I am worth a fortune
No snowflake feels responsible in an avalanche
You will receive a fortune cookie
Some fortune cookies contain no fortune
Don't let statistics do a number on you
You are not illiterate
May you someday be carbon neutral
